# Retrograde motion of Mars as seen from the Earth.
This Python code simulates the **retrograde motion of Mars**, a phenomenon where Mars appears to reverse its direction temporarily when observed from Earth. This occurs due to the relative motion of Earth and Mars as they orbit the Sun at different speeds. Earth, being closer to the Sun, moves faster in its orbit, and when it overtakes Mars, the line of sight from Earth to Mars creates the illusion of backward motion in the night sky.

The code numerically simulates the orbital motion of both Earth and Mars around the Sun using their angular velocities. It calculates and visualizes key parameters, such as the positions of the planets, the angle between the Earth-Mars line and the Mars-Sun line, and the distance between Earth and Mars. Additionally, it animates the planetary orbits and provides live plots of angles and distances, updating dynamically with the motion. This project illustrates the mechanics behind retrograde motion without relying on Newtonian gravity, instead focusing on the relative motion and angular velocities of the planets.
